# AI Coding.
I've been trying to delve into coding for a while and since I was learning on how to be a better designer (Not saying that Im a better designer ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) it was very hard for me to maintain both aspects of learning and hence I thought of focusing only on the design aspect.

But since, AI tools like Trae and Cursor emerged, its been helping me alot in learning and helping me to recall what I've learned.

So, after lots of attempts and tryouts I've built this site using Astro and React with the help of Trae.


# Playstation

<p>Even though I had many different consoles over the years for gaming ranging from the Gameboy era to Rog ally (which is technically a PC), my recent aquisition of Playstation 5 has allowed me to experience the ways in which controllers could provide a different experience to the user.</p>

<p>I'm in an absolute awe about the way it handles haptics and provides a surround system by providing sound through the joy stick itself.</p>

## Playing Spiderman
I‚Äôve always leaned toward PC when it comes to gaming. More control, better performance, ability to mod things the way I like. Console exclusivity always felt unnecessary to me. Why lock great games to a specific platform is what I thought all the time and I hated that some consoles charged more for games than their PC versions.

But playing Spider-Man 2 on the PS5 made me pause a bit.

There‚Äôs something about it. The way the controller reacts to what‚Äôs happening on screen, the haptic feedbacks, the way controller produces sound on shooting the web... It‚Äôs hard to explain, but it felt right, just like the game was meant to live on that hardware.

I remember Steve jobs quoting Allen kay in one of his presentation as "To build a great software you have to build a great hardware" and the console exclusivity just felt like the same. maybe it isnt just about gatekeeping. Maybe it‚Äôs about building something deeply optimized, where the hardware and software are fully in sync. That kind of tight integration isn‚Äôt easy to replicate.

WOW, that sounds like my next post :D. Well, more on the holistic experience later.
