September’s been a mix of gaming highs, building the portfolios, and unexpected injuries. Here’s a snapshot of what kept me busy (and sometimes injured) this month.

# The Ghost
Absolutely loved the game, from story to gameplay and to the visuals, it was a treat for both the eyes and ears. I’d heard about it for a while, but since I didn’t have a PlayStation, I never got the chance to play. I thought Sekiro would scratch that itch, but instead it just reminded me how bad I am as a player, rather than making me want to keep playing.

Where the game truly shines is in its story. It sets the stage beautifully, helping the player understand who they are as the protagonist and how they should approach the journey. That said, one area felt a bit disappointing: the forced assassin missions with Yuna. The game spends so much time talking about honor and the samurai way of life, only to push you into stealth kills just because Yuna is scared :/.

The game initially blew me out by saying that it can start as a Japanese movie, where the characters speaks in japanese and I would have english subtitles. The game also had a Kurosawa style where the game is in black and white mimicking the Akira Kurosawa, Take that for immersion!!

Still, it’s far better than the Spider-Man games where you pay €50–60 to play as Spider-Man, only to be forced into playing Mary Jane especially during in heat of the moment (what in the actual hell?).

I’m still working my way through Ghost of Tsushima and plan to write about it in more detail later.
# Finishing the Portfolio
Speaking of writing — since finishing my portfolio (or as I like to call it, my wiki) 12 days ago, I’ve been planning a bunch of posts related to it: how I built it, and what I’m currently learning.

Here’s one I’ve already published: <Link href="/notes/whythissite/">Why I Built This Site</Link>, where I dive into the reasons behind creating it.

# The Injury
September turned out to be a pretty testing month. First, I got hit with a fever, and then I managed to injure myself on a bench press :D. With the gym off-limits and long hours straining my neck, I used the downtime to finally optimize my ROG Ally — or rather, free it from its toxic relationship with Windows (read: I installed SteamOS).

I should probably also write about how handheld gaming devices are carving out their place in the industry, especially now that devices like the PlayStation Portal are being so well received.
In the meantime, here are my physical companions that kept me sane this month (and probably will for the next few):

All in all, September felt like a strange blend of recovery, creativity, and play. Between samurai duels, debugging Astro collections, and experimenting with handheld consoles, I’ve got plenty more to write about in the weeks ahead and I pray that I write more :D
