## Brief
As the first and Sole UX designer within the studio, I was responsible for setting up UX in the roadmap along with establishing synergies across the team.

## Challenges
- Elder users (higher level) were getting stagnant and their engagement was dropping
- Users were churning off during onboarding

## Solutions
We built **tournament systems** to address the low engagement from elder users, after **conducting multiple focus groups, market analysis, qualitative and quantitative surveys**

### Define
  Based on our researches, we decided to create a tournament which goes hand in hand with the game progression while eliminating the Pay to win scenario. Pay to win scenario arises when the user who spends more money with in game have an upper hand all the time apart from experience.
