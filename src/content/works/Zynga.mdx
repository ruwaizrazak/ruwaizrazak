Involved in all aspects of the product lifecycle, from brainstorming and defining requirements with PMs to designing and testing interfaces, as well as working with engineers to make sure everything comes together just right.

Unfortunately, due to NDA agreement, Im not allowed to share the bulk of work that I did at Zynga. So for now, I would have to claim and you have to trust that I did quiet a lot during the 4.5 years I spent at Zynga.
I stepped down as a Senior User Experience Designer from the Farmville 3 team.

### Here are few projects I worked at Zynga.

Sadly, Empires and Allies is no more (yes, Zynga sunsetted the game after 8 incredible years). But It was dear and close to my heart thanks to my amazing team mates and passionate users, who always pushes us to be the best. Here is a short video of some of the games.
