How many times in your life have you wondered seeing the alternative possibilities of a particular product? We, humans are creative, we tend to find opportunities from every single thing that come across in our lives. Be it using Instagram for showcasing your merchandise, or checking internet availability by typing "google.com" in your browser.


Identifying alternative opportunities or utilising the product beyond its intentional use is cool. However, we, humans tend to use products in our own way regardless of the intended purpose of the product leads to unintended consequences.

## What is unintended consequences?
I ran a search in google seeking the definition of unintended consequences returned with this:

> "In the social sciences, unintended consequences are outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and intended by a purposeful action." - Robert Merton.

When i read that, it didn't sound so alarming to me, but then when i logged into LinkedIn i saw a post from one of my follower and it says: "You have Facebook, Instagram and specifically tinder for dating, please don't use LinkedIn for seeking your potential dating targets". Now, this left me disturbed, i was puzzled, and i felt bad.

Coincidentally, i was sent to Designup Conference 2017, which was held in Bangalore by my company then, Kerala Startup Mission where i heard Alysha Naples talking about unintended consequences and that helped me to broader my understanding.

During her session, she mentioned one of her experience from the game "Journey" in which, another player in the game was drawing a heart to her without knowing who she is. When the journey team designed the game, they never thought about the ability of game to give an emotional connection to the player in the aforementioned manner.

> "I cried, I cried for about an hour. I felt like this person whose name i didnt know. It can be anyone, we stuck together, fought together, we struggle together and i felt an intensely deep sense of gratitude for being there and leaving this beautiful message to me at the end" - Alysha Naples

While the experience from journey was benelovent and touchy, there can be some instances in which users might go to the dark side to satisfy their evil intensions. One among those was reported by a female player who was playing QuiVr on 2017. She was playing the game with 5 unknown teammates and at some point she has to yell through voice channel. As soon as her teammates heard her voice, they realized that their teammate is a woman. They started chasing her and groping her avatar. Even though, the woman was safe in the coziness of her room, this incident made her feel that she was being violated.

Along with this I need to mention that, QuiVr replied to article with an update which helps players to create a force field around them which will avoid other players from the vicinity.

## Is unintended consequences only affecting games?
You've guessed it right. Unintended consequences was in existance since the day mankind started innovation. Did you thought that Karl Benz wanted the world to be filled with cars which spits tons of carbon dioxide and other toxic gases and inturn cause damage to earth?

I'm not sure how many of you are aware of sql injection. Its one of the most common hacking method in which the hacker injects code which could destroy the entire data base via an input field, which is used to accept inputs from the users. Most of the web companies are taking precautions to prevent these type of attacks in the current era.

Talking about unintended consequences, one of my friend who was learning from a popular MOOC platform received a message from another user in  who reviewed her project as a part of their peer-to-peer assessment praising her physical beauty and seeking her private number. Result, she felt violated and threatned thinking that if she doesnt give her cellphone number, the other guy wont be giving enough score to her assignment.

If you notice the pattern i shared above, you will realise that its been there, and its all prevailing. From knives to the most sophisticated tech. If not designed properly, all of them have the ability to cause something which was never intended during its production stage.

## Can we prevent unintended consequences?

Well, Most of them. I know, i wanted to say all of them. The fact that we cant manipulate or control human mind with an /Imperial curse/ is the only reason im saying that we cant get rid of unintended consequences all together.

I believe that Designers can prevent unintended consequences by considering the following steps:
1. Asking the right questions
2. What is really being said
3. Wearing the black hat
4. Observing the usage of the product.


### Asking the right questions

When we are designing something, we need to ask ourselves questions like, why are we designing these? What are the elements are we going to have in these? why do we need these elements? who are the users of this product?

Referring to the experience my friend had from MOOC learning platform, this situation wont ever happen if the peer who reviewed her assignment couldnt see her profile picture or name. Being an active user of the same platform, i believe that peer's name and profile picture doesnt add any value to the process as you are merely reviewing the assignments. Hence, if the designers from that particular company has asked the questions related to the visibility of profile picture and name to themselves, this situation could've been avoided.


### What is really being said?

This is something designers often gets into. There can be instances when someone from product team approaches the designers and says "Hey, do you know, our users just responded in survey that they wants text messaging in our latest VR product". This is the moment we need to differentiate the form and the essence.

The form might differ, but the essence always remains same. If users replied affirmative to a question towards having a text message feature in a latest VR app. It might mean that they wants something in the app using which they can easily communicate with the people whom they care about.


### Wearing the blackhat.

I love to believe that all of us wants to be the good guys. Most of us, believes that we want to change the world for better good. However, while designing a product which we wants to make a social impact, we need to wear the blackhat. We need to consider ourselves as a villain who tries to manipulate the social aspects of our product to achieve evil motives.

> Is a knife evil? Only if the weilder is evil.

### Observing the usage of the product.

Amongst all, this is my favourite part. When the female gamer reported about the terrible experience she had in QuiVr with her teammates. QuiVr team reciprocated with a solution to avoid further repeatation of that incident.

No matter how hard we try, there can be instances in which we couldnt think of a particular scenario which might affect in bad experience to a player.

> Own mistakes, Improvise on it. Unintended consequences can be avoided if we are vigilant about it pre and post stages of production.

Thank you.
