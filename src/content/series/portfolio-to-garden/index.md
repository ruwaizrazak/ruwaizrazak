This series is designed for complete beginners who want to learn web development from scratch. We'll start with HTML structure, move through CSS styling, and finish with JavaScript interactivity.

This series is a collection of notes tracing my evolving relationship with web. From the first time I published to building my current site with Astro. 

Each phase marks a a set of jigsaws I have found yet in my life. The jigsaw of learning, design, code and expression. I might find new ones and they might end up here.

What began as a simple portfolio became a personal garden, a space to think in public, document experiments and grow alongside the tools I use.
