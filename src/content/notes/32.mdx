I turned 32 today.  
It doesn’t feel dramatic, but a quiet pause in the year.  
A moment to check in with myself and notice how I’ve been moving through life.

32 feels calm.  
Not lonely, but clearer.  
Like the noises got dialed down and I can finally hear myself again.  

Fewer impulses, more purpose.  
Less rushing, more choosing.

This year showed me that clarity rarely arrives loudly.  
It slips in through tiny moments and one has to be sharp enough to notice them and stack them up.


## Fitness  
My relationship with fitness has shifted too.  

It used to be about looking strong, now it’s about functional in a way that feels useful.  

I care more about functional strength, handstands, dips, pull ups, push ups, and the muscle conditioning that supports those movements.  

Movements that feel practical, alive, and connected to my body rather than aesthetic, Im not there yet, but its a pursuit.

BJJ recently became a  part of this journey, not for competition, but because it demands presence, balance, discipline, and humility.  

It builds a different kind of strength, the kind that teaches you how to stay calm and think while you’re under pressure, both physically and mentally.

## Learning  
Learning has been a constant theme this year.  
AI-assisted learning in particular opened a new door for me.  
Tools that don’t answer questions but *think with me*.  
I even wrote about it (<Link src="https://www.ruwaizrazak.com/notes/aitoolsascreativepartners">AI Tools as Creative Partners</Link>) as it genuinely changed how I approach projects, ideas, and curiosity.

I’m learning Serbian, partly to challenge my brain, but also to build deeper rapport with people around me.  

There’s something grounding about learning the language of the place you live in. It makes the world feel less distant and humbles you a lot. It reminds me of how my school days where I don’t remember when a teacher is quizzing :D .

I’m restarted my journey with Swift (again), picking things up through *Hacking with Swift*.  

It’s a slow build, but a satisfying one, like putting together a toolkit that will help me to build few small things that I want for myself.

## Finance  
Finance is another area which I’ve been learning quietly.  
I’m nowhere near an expert, but I’m learning to manage it with a more intentional, utility-first mindset.  
Not about wealth in the loud sense but more about understanding how money flows, how to use it well, how to keep things stable.

I still remember the stage in which I reached a point where I didn’t have to worry about the small, day-to-day expenses anymore and that introduced a different paradigm for me. Now I want to make it wider. By learning more and being intentional about it.  

It’s not about having “a lot,” but about having enough clarity and stability to think about life in a cleaner way.

## Writing  
I restarted writing this year, and it feels like returning to a part of myself I forgot about.  

To keep the momentum, I began a small series and wrote a couple of essays, nothing grand, just honest thoughts put into words.  
Writing has become a way for me to process things, to express clearly, and to accelerate my learning.  

It helps me stack, articulate and stage what I’ve learned from different areas design, fitness, tech, psychology, life and turn them into something I can revisit, refine, and eventually understand better.  

It’s less about being a “writer” and more about creating a record of who I’m becoming.


## Looking toward 33  
I’m not planning dramatic changes just cleaner ones.  

- Build more things for myself.  
- Write consistently.  
- Train with purpose, not ego.  
- Learn with curiosity, not pressure.  
- Take care of my body before it complains.  
- Move at a pace that feels sustainable, not performative.

So here’s my reminder for the year ahead:  
- Doesnt have to outrun anything.  
- Compounding is the magic I need to strive for.  
- Stay curious, choose what feels true, and let the rest unfold at its own pace.

That’s enough.
