Hi, I’m Ruwaiz.

I’m a designer–builder with experience shipping large-scale mobile products,
and a growing practice of learning by building the things I design.

This GitHub reflects how I work; close to the surface,curious about systems and human behavior,and deliberate about details.

For a complete view of my work and thinking:

### Background

- Senior User Experience Designer with 7+ years of experience
- Designed for high-scale, long-lived mobile products
- Worked across product definition, interaction design, and live systems

My interest in building comes from wanting tighter feedback loops and better alignment between intent and execution.

---

### Tools & Mediums

- **Design:** Quantitative & qualitative research, interaction design, prototyping
- **Code:** Swift, SwiftUI, JavaScript, React
- **Web:** Astro, HTML, CSS

I use code as a thinking tool to test assumptions, understand constraints, and learn how systems behave in practice.

### What you’ll see here

- Learning projects and technical explorations
- Code written to test ideas and understand trade-offs
- Iterations, experiments, and work-in-progress artifacts

This where I test my recipes, and it is intentionally made messier :D.
