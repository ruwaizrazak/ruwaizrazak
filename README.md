# Ruwaiz Razak's Personal Website

> Disclaimer: This README was generated by Cursor and structured by me as I was too lazy to write about how I built this :D

This is my personal website and digital garden, built to showcase my essays, notes, book library, case studies, and social media activity from the Fediverse while learning and practicing front-end developement using react.

## Tech Stack

- **[Astro](https://astro.build/)**: The core framework for building fast, modern static and server-rendered sites
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and maintainable code
- **Vercel**: For continuous deployment and hosting

## Features

- **Content Collections**: Notes, essays, books, works, and case studies are managed as Markdown/MDX files using Astro's content collections
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly layout
- **Fediverse Integration**: Surfaces posts from Mastodon and Pixelfed using their public APIs
- **Bookshelf**: Displays both my local book notes and my Goodreads "Want to Read" shelf via the Goodreads RSS feed
- **Tag System**: Browse content by tags, including tags from Fediverse posts
- **Automated Deployments**: GitHub Actions workflows trigger Vercel deployments when new content is detected

## APIs & Integrations

- **Mastodon API**: Fetches my latest public posts, including media, engagement metrics, and context
- **Pixelfed RSS**: Surfaces my latest photo posts. (I tried integrating the API, but it was bit cumbersome and the ROI wasnt appealing.)
- **Goodreads RSS Feed**: Integrates my "Want to Read" shelf by parsing the public RSS feed from Goodreads
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates content updates and site deployments

## How It Works

- **Content**: Most content is written in Markdown/MDX
- **Components**: UI is built with Astro components and styled with Tailwind CSS
- **APIs**: Custom utility functions fetch and parse data from Mastodon, Pixelfed, and Goodreads
- **Pages**: Dynamic and static pages are generated using Astro's file-based routing
- **Deployment**: Every push to `main` triggers a Vercel deployment, and workflows can also trigger deploys when new Fediverse or Goodreads content is detected
